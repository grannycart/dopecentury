* solo-operator submarine failure
    * the sounds of the tanks failing, descending
    * writing a final note: I am still in love with you
* Jack Bauer style internal dialog
    * Pulling race radio out of his ear
    * "Time! time! give me the time!"
* rules of the smug god
* sonic titan: a huge sound that travels across the lanscape
* a paleolithic father and daughter walk barefoot across a muddy landscape full of mammoths, sloths, and saber-toothed monster. They are starving and heard that a group nearby had secured a large pile of meat.
    * possibly good for the phonetics experiment
        * make a list of phonetic elements that can be used, derived from dopecentury X
    * pick up where dopecentury X left off, and continue the story in a later Dopecentury entry

    * run-on sentences, whole paragraph sentences.
    * grammaer
    * alternative punctuation
