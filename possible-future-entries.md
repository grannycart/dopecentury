# Possible future entries:
* cliffside mining machines
* space laser gun guidance pod
* huge cargo submarine docking facility with sub tugs
* solo-operator submarine failure
    * the sounds of the tanks failing, descending
    * writing a final note: I am still in love with you
* Jack Bauer style internal dialog
    * Pulling race radio out of his ear
    * "Time! time! give me the time!"
* rules of the smug god
* sonic titan: a huge sound that travels across the lanscape
* phonetics-only description of something
* a paleolithic father and daughter walk barefoot across a muddy landscape full of mammoths, sloths, and saber-toothed monster. They are starving and heard that a group nearby had secured a large pile of meat.
    * possibly good for the phonetics experiment
